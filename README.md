# TicketWonder
Wonderful ticket experience with state machines

Solving the problem of waiting in a concert ticket queue forever and then getting booted at the end with no tickets.
Real people can get verified with phone number
The ticket numbers available will be checked before sending people in the wait queue.
Periodically the person will get a phone notification to make sure they are still waiting and they have to respond to the code received
When the turn is up, they'll get a text notification to go purchase the tickets

It eliminates long waiting times and prevents scalpers from buying real tickets.
